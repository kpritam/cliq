title: Effect Deep Dive Overview
description: Study how the Effect runtime powers cliq—layer composition, managed services, error handling, performance, and prompt design.
---

This track explains the internals that make cliq deterministic and hackable. Each article traces real code and highlights the Effect patterns behind it.

## Topics

- [Effect fundamentals](/docs/effect/effect-fundamentals) — generators, `Effect.all`, resource scoping, and error channels.
- [Layers & dependency injection](/docs/effect/layers-and-dependency-injection) — composing the runtime graph in `src/cli.ts`.
- [Services & managed runtimes](/docs/effect/services-and-managed-runtimes) — structuring services as tags and running them safely.
- [Error recovery](/docs/effect/error-recovery) — surfacing causes, retry strategies, and safe shutdowns.
- [Performance & concurrency](/docs/effect/performance-and-concurrency) — streaming, batching, and parallel effects.
- [Prompt design](/docs/effect/prompt-design) — building the system prompt and tool-aware instructions.

## When to read these

- You are extending cliq to new platforms or adding complex services.
- You want to understand how Effect layers enforce dependency boundaries.
- You are optimising streaming performance or investigating failure modes.

Prefer the [Build Series](/docs/build-series/overview) if you need hands-on labs, or the [Mechanics track](/docs/mechanics/overview) for subsystem walkthroughs.
