| Command | Description | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/help` | Show available commands and usage hints. | `src/chat/SlashCommandHandler.ts` |
| `/model` | Change provider and model (`provider:model`). | `src/chat/SlashCommandHandler.ts` |
| `/exit` | Gracefully terminate the chat session. | `src/chat/SlashCommandHandler.ts` |

All commands run inside the same Effect runtime as messages, so they can call services or tools if needed.

:::tip Add your own
Follow the pattern in `SlashCommandHandler`: add the command to `SLASH_COMMANDS`, implement a handler, and branch on it in `handleSlashCommand`.
